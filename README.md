# NAV-of-Investments
A simple Front end form which takes date and invested amount as a parameter and computes the investment value as of today. For example, If I had invested Rs. 10,000 in Axis Long Term Equity Fund - Direct Plan on 13/May/2016, when the NAV value was 26.5481, I would have purchased 376.67 Units. That investment today would be worth Rs. 17019.08/- (on 07'th Feb For ex).

To achieve the above you would need to download the entire NAV history of a given fund. You can download complete NAV history of a mutual fund house from here http://portal.amfiindia.com/DownloadNAVHistoryReport_Po.aspx?mf=53&tp=1&frmdt=01-Apr-2015&todt=20-Mar-2019 
The URL above is for Axis Mutual fund.

Constraints 
Assume all investment happened after 01-Apr-2015.
